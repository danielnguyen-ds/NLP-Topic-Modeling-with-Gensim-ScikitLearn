The main aim of topic modeling is to use mathematical and statistical techniques to discover hidden and latent semantic structures in a corpus.\n","- Topic modeling involves extracting features from document terms and using mathematical structures and frameworks like matrix factorization and SVD to generate clusters or groups of terms that are distinguishable from each other and these cluster of words form topics or concepts. These concepts can be used to interpret the main themes of a corpus and make semantic connections among words that co-occur frequently in various documents.\n","\n","We build some topic models using
